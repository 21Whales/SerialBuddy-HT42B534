## Overview

SerialBuddy-HT42B534 is a USB to UART interface based on the Holtek HT42B534 chip, designed with a focus on simplicity and versatility. It is suitable for breadboard use, featuring clearly labeled pins and supporting dual voltage supply (3.3V and 5V). The device also offers selectable I/O voltage (3.3V or 5V), and excludes less commonly used pins like RTS and CTS for a streamlined user experience. SerialBuddy-HT42B534 is an open-source hardware project distributed under the BSD 3-Clause License.
